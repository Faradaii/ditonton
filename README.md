## Technologies Used  

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=git,github,flutter,firebase,androidstudio" />  

This application was developed using Git, GitHub, Android Studio, Firebase, and Flutter as the primary framework.  


## Challenges - Solutions - Impact  

The development of this application faced several challenges, including continuing code that previously only had a movies feature, implementing modularization, transforming state management from Provider to BLoC, performing unit and widget tests, understanding user behavior demographics, detecting crashes in the application, and implementing Continuous Integration.  

### Challenges  

- Interacting with APIs and displaying data from APIs.  
- Developing existing code.  
- Separating into multiple modules/packages.  
- Transforming state management to be more reactive.  
- Building scalable and maintainable code for future development.  
- Understanding user behavior demographics.  
- Detecting crashes when the application is publicly used.  
- Implementing CI for automation.  

### Solutions  

- Using the `http` dependency to interact with APIs.  
- Implementing clean architecture with dependency injection using `get_it`.  
- Applying existing patterns to maintain code consistency.  
- Implementing unit, page, and widget tests to ensure code functions correctly.  
- Implementing Firebase Analytics for real-time demographic reports.  
- Implementing Firebase Crashlytics for crash reports when users experience issues.  
- Using Codemagic for Continuous Integration.  

### Impact  

- The application requires an internet connection since data is not stored in a database.  
- The application presents movie and TV series information effectively.  
- The application is scalable and can be further developed.  
- User demographics and crash history can be monitored through the Firebase console.  
- Automated testing is triggered upon repository push.  

## Lesson Learned  

From this project, I learned about using Flutter as an application framework. This application taught me how to interact with APIs, build applications using clean architecture, implement Firebase, conduct unit, page, and widget tests, and apply Continuous Integration.  

- Improved my understanding of Flutter.  
- Helped me understand API interactions.  
- Helped me understand state management with BLoC and dependency injection using `get_it`.  
- Helped me understand Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.  
- Helped me understand CI with Codemagic in Flutter.
